- [ ] Manual override functionality for AI suggestions
- [ ] **Habit Detection**: AI identifies emerging user patterns
- [ ] **Smart Weekly Focus**: AI suggests optimal attribute focus
- [ ] Basic analytics and progress tracking

### Week 7-8: Enhanced Integration
- [ ] Social login integration (Google/Apple)
- [ ] **Apple Health/Google Fit Integration**: Auto-import and classify workouts
- [ ] **Smart Reminders**: Context-aware notification timing
- [ ] AI confidence scoring and learning from user corrections
- [ ] Performance optimization for AI calls

## ðŸ¤– AI Enhancement Features

### Habit Detection & Suggestions
```javascript
// AI analyzes user patterns to suggest improvements
const analyzeUserHabits = (userEntries, timeframe = 30) => {
  // Identify recurring activities
  // Suggest complementary activities
  // Detect gaps in attribute development
  // Recommend optimal timing for activities
};
```

### Smart Weekly Focus
- **Algorithm**: Analyze user's attribute balance and suggest focus area
- **Personalization**: Consider user preferences and past performance
- **Variety**: Ensure suggestions rotate to prevent monotony
- **Difficulty**: Gradually increase challenge based on user progress

### Apple Health Integration
- **Auto-Import**: Fetch workout data and classify automatically
- **Activity Mapping**: Map health app activities to SPECIAL attributes
- **Smart Notifications**: Suggest logging when activities are detected
- **Validation**: Allow users to confirm or adjust AI classifications

## ðŸ“Š Advanced Analytics Implementation

### Progress Prediction
- [ ] **Timeline Forecasting**: "At your current pace, you'll reach Strength 50 in 3 months"
- [ ] **Optimal Timing Analysis**: When users are most likely to complete activities
- [ ] **Streak Analysis**: Identify patterns in consistency
- [ ] **Bottleneck Detection**: Find attributes holding back overall progress

### Smart Notifications
- [ ] **Optimal Reminder Times**: AI learns when each user is most responsive
- [ ] **Context-Aware Prompts**: "Long day at work? Try meditation for Perception"
- [ ] **Streak Protection**: Smart alerts when streaks are at risk
- [ ] **Celebration Timing**: Perfect moments for achievement celebrations

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2 Goals
- Intelligent activity classification with 80%+ accuracy
- Dynamic point allocation system working smoothly
- Basic habit detection and smart suggestions
- Health app integration for major platforms
- Foundation for social features in Phase 3
